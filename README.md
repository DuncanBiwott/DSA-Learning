Day 1 - Monday 8/01/2024 - With the Guide by Justus
-  I Went through the Python basics and practiced writing a Python code for basics to grasp well the language for better understanding and easy implementation in the DSA and Projects
-  Learned the basic function defination and implementation in inside Classes and independent to perform a given functionality in code and to ensure a clean code which is a good practice
-  Learned Data Structures in Python by getting to understand the core data structures which exists in Python for efficient data storage and and operation for data manipulations in the structure
-  Data Structures learned include Lists,Arrays,Tuples,Sets and Dictionaries
-  Practiced writing code to implement each data structure and tried to solve some basics problems to understand how each works as shown in the DSA Repository in the main Branch
- Used the Resources available here:
  - ![#f03c15](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python)
    -![#f03c15](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/?ref=shm_outind)

Day 2 - Tuesday 9/01/2024
- Learning and Understanding the Time Complexities and Space Complexities of different Operations in different data structure represented by Big O Notation
- Understood the Memory and Running time trade off
- Practiced writing code to analyze the time complexity an operation takes to completion and ensure better operation of the algorithm on intense data imput
- Created code which demonstrates the implementation of O(1)- Constant Time, O(N) Linear Time , O(N^2) Exponential Time
- Learning Single LinkedList and writing a code the implement the LinkedList and perform operations on the Nodes in the LinkedList
- The Operations include:
      Append O(1)
      Pop O(n)
      Prepend O(1)
      Pop First O(1)
      Insert O(n)
      Remove O(n)
      Lookup by Index O(n)
      Look up by value O(n)
